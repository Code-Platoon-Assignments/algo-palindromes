# Palindrome Challenge

## What is a Palindrome?

"A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward, such as madam or kayak." - Wikipedia

## Requirements

* Write a function that takes in a word as a parameter and determines if the word is a palindrome. The function should indicate that the word is or isn't a palindrome by returning True or Falsee. 
* Your function should be able to handle both integers and strings.

## Test Your Code

Remember. Red, Green, Refactor. You should start this exercise by running the test spec, palindrome_spec.py (```python palindrome_spec.py```). After the tests fail, write code to make them pass.

## Challenge Yourself

* Allow your palindrome checker to check against palindromic sentences such as, "Sore was I ere I saw Eros." and "A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama"
